Three balls with gravity. 

Collisions between two balls are calculated in coordinate system of one of the balls using relative speed and pulse. 

Weigth of any ball is considered to be the same, all collisions are central and absolutely elastic. 

The lower border of the screen provides collisions with little loss of energy.
